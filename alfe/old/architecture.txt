We have a set of objects created during parsing (ParseTreeObjects), which have span()s.
Some objects (e.g. types and functions) aren't created during parsing, so have no span()s.
To avoid carrying a lot of excess empty Span variables around, we should have objects without spans, and have the ParseTreeObjects point to them (own them).
Some of these objects will have (weak) back pointers to the ParseTreeObjects.

What should symbol tables contain?
  Key is an Identifier (or TycoIdentifier)
  Value is an object without span


OR:
Forget about having a separate Type class, and put everything in the ParseTreeObject


The advantage of having Tyco separate from TycoDefinitionStatement is not (just) avoid having excess Spans floating around. It is that:
  1) there are Tyco objects which have no associated TycoDefinitionStatement
  2) there are TycoDefinitionStatements which have no associated Tyco
  3) the two classes are used in different ways and have different connotations
