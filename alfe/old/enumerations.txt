ALFE enums are modelled after C++11 enum classes.
  Instead of being dumped into the parent namespace, enum items need to be qualified with the type name of the enum

An enum can have any number of conversions built in - these are specified as columns in the original declaration.

If no string conversion is specified but value.toString() is called (or, equivalently, value is used as an insert in a string), then a string conversion is generated automatically, by stringifying
 the identifiers.
