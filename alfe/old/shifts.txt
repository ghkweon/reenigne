What should the results of "1 << -1" and "1 << 64" be?
  Rational(1, 2)  and 0x10000000000000000 respectively? Or undefined?
    Can get back the undefined (and hence high-performance) behavior back with undefined behavior (assert)
    But could also implement the uniform behavior implementation in terms of the undefined behavior ones
      It would be easier to implement the pattern recognition in the case where the behavior is well defined
