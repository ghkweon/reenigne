Two similar ways of creating objects:

Structure { ... }
Class { ... }

Structure is the equivalent of a C++ struct or class
  Inherit from Object, which has no members
  Passed by value
  Can be allocated on stack, heap or inside another object

Class is the equivalent of a Java or C# class
  Inherit from Handle, which is a pointer
  Body is heap allocated and reference counted
  Any Class can also be written as a Structure.
    T = Class : Base { ... } is equivalent to:
      T = Structure : Base
      {
          ...
          operator=<@U>(U other) { _bpdy = other._bpdy; if (!valid()) throw; }
          constructor<@U>(U other) { *this = other; }
      private:
          Body = Structure : Base::Structure { ... };
          Body* body() { return dynamic_cast<Body*>(_body); }
      };
  Compiler generates a Structure method for each Body method
  Casting from one Class type to another does the appropriate Body dynamic cast
  Excess dynamic casting is optimized away


Also have Immutable which inherits from ConstReference?







Foo<@T> = Class { ... };

Foo<@T> where T : Bar = Class { ... };

Foo<@T, @U> where T : U = Class { ... };




Inner classes:

It would be nice to be able to access outer class members from an inner class

A = Structure {
  Int a;
  B = Structure {
    Int b;
    Int foo()
    {
      return a+b;
    }
  };
};

Which instance of the inner class is used? There needs to be an implicit "A* outer" pointer in B which is dereferenced to find outer class members
  Only added if B methods reference outer class members
  Any B created by an A method is automatically given an outer_chain pointer equal to this.
    It then must be illegal to create a B from outside an A context, because there's no valid
  Should "outer" be reference counted?
    Maybe only if A inherits from Reference


Inner objects/functions:

Four cases to consider:
  Function inside object
    This is just a method.
    There is an implicit "this" pointer passed to the function as a hidden first parameter.
    Taking the address of the function yields something which must be combined with an object pointer to become callable.
      Might just be a free function pointer with an extra parameter
    Can also make a closure by taking the address of the (method, object) pair - that can be called like a normal function but is larger than a naked function pointer
  Function inside function
    This is a nested function similar to how they work in modern C++
    Variables from outer function are automatically available to inner function
    There is a static chain pointer "here" that points to the stack frame of the outer function
    Taking the address of the inner function yields something which must be combined with a stack frame pointer to become callable.
      Might just be a free function pointer with an extra parameter
    Can also make a closure by taking the address of the (function, context) pair - that can be called like a normal function but is larger than a naked function pointer
  Object inside object
    Inner object contains pointer to outer object
    Constructors of inner object require an extra parameter which is the outer object pointer
    Generally we would not expect to be to hand off a type C to a template and expect that template to be able to do "Auto x = new C;"
      As a matter of convention, also don't pass a context object e and have the template do "auto x = new C(e);"
      Instead we should be passing an object f, and the template should be calling it to create the object: "Auto x = f->create<C>();"
  Object inside function
    Similar to other cases by analogy
    Creating the object needs environment pointer
    In this case there is no outer object to pass to a template to create objects
      We can instead pass a closure to the template: "Container<C> c(function() { return new C; });"
        The closure doesn't look like it captures anything, but if C's methods use the environment then "new C" implicitly passes the environment pointer to the C constructor, so the closure must capture it.
        This also works for the object inside object case
When resolving names, the compiler does a depth-first seach of the (environment, parent) tree
  To disambiguate, can use this->, environment-> or parent-> (here-> is also possible but the default)
Prioritise ALFE to C++ translator so that I can play with this. But in the meantime (and for implementing the translator) it would be a good idea to:
  Have ALFE objects (e.g. Type) derive from something that has a context object

Functions all have a hidden parameter for context
  For free functions, the context is a pointer to the activation record of the enclosing function
  For member functions, the context is the "this" pointer
Classes all have a hidden parameter for context
  For classes inside classes, the context is the pointer to the outer object
  For classes inside functions, the context is the pointer to the activation record of the enclosing function
These context pointers are optimised away if not used
A class constructor has two hidden parameters, one for the "this" pointer and one for the context
Because a context must be provided, can't construct a class outside of the context that defined it. So naming a type is not necessarily enough to construct it.
  When passing a type to a class or function template, need to pass a hidden context value parameter for that type as well
  If we try to use a type outside of the context where it was defined, we might get an error
    Having classes expose types to their outside is too useful to give up, so we won't forbid it altogether
      instead of saying "A.B b = A.B();", need to say "Auto x = a.B();" - B constructor is automatically a member of class A.
Can we use a type name as an expression, giving us a default-constructed value of that type?
  Would be nice for having True and False like Haskell, instead of writing True() and False()
  Problem is then we have ambiguity between A() meaning a default-constructed A and a default constructed value of type A() (function returning A)
  Could forbid the shorthand for function types, since we never get a useful value by default-constructing a function type anyway



It would be nice to have code in a class definition:
  1) To generalise member initialisers.
  2( To make it easier to write a constructor if you only want one
    What if you don't want a constructor at all? Or if you want to restrict access to the constructor?
      How about any code in the class definition runs before all member constructors (but after base class constructor), but otherwise contructors work like C++ ones
        For translation, copy the code into each constructor
          Though some of it can run before member constructors, in which case a more complicated translation may be necessary to be accurate - a base class?
        Member variables left unconstructed can be constructed by class constructors instead, otherwise they can't.
